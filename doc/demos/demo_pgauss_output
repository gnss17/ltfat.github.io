Type "help demo_pgauss" to see a description of how this demo works.
Test of DFT invariance: Should be close to zero.

ans =

     2.481524897647706e-15

The function is WP even. The following should be 1.

ans =

     1

Therefore, its DFT is real.
The norm of the imaginary part should be close to zero.

ans =

     1.501312721600895e-15
